# Basespaceapp Syntax

The syntax for .mp files is as follows.


## Structure

Each command in the pipeline should be on their own line and have the following
structure:

```
[command alias] command [flags] {input/output pattern} 

Example
-------

1. cut -f 1 some_file > {o}
```

In this example, the command cut is given the alias `1` and cuts column 1 
from `some_file` and puts it in an output file called `some_file.1`.

**Note:** The alias for a file can be anything, as long as it's unique in the
pipeline.


### Input Patterns

Consider the following command:

```
[COMMANDS]
python somescript {1||2||3}

[FILES]
1. some_file1.txt
2. some_file2.txt
3. some_file3.txt
```

This command will run the python script 3 times in parallel, once with each 
file specified. The output will look something like this:

```
Output
------

python somescript some_file1.txt
python somescript some_file2.txt
python somescript some_file3.txt
```

#### Running a script with multiple inputs

Let's say that you have a script with takes multiple files as input. In this
case the syntax becomes:

```
[COMMANDS]
python somescript {1,2,3}

[FILES]
1. some_file1.txt
2. some_file2.txt
3. some_file3.txt

Output
------

>>> python somescript some_file1.txt some_file2.txt some_file3.txt
```


#### Multiple steps and file names

[TODO]


### Output Patterns

Whenever a script would take an explicit output filename you can use the output
pattern syntax to tell basespaceapp where/what it should use.

```
[COMMANDS]
python somescript -o {o} {1||2||3}

[FILES]
1. some_file1.txt
2. some_file2.txt
3. some_file3.txt

Output
------

python somescript -o basespaceapp.1.1.output some_file1.txt
python somescript -o basespaceapp.1.2.output some_file2.txt
python somescript -o basespaceapp.1.3.output some_file3.txt
```

Basespaceapp will generate the filename with the command's alias inside. An upcoming feature will provide more useful output names.


#### Implicit or Hardcoded output

In a case where the script or command you want to use generates an output that
is not passed through the command, but you need to use for another step in the
pipeline, you can use output patterns to tell basespaceapp what to look for.

Consider this:

```
[COMMANDS]
./do_count {1||2}
./analyze.sh {1.*}


[FILES]
1. foo.txt
2. bar.txt
```

This set of commands is invalid because the second command (`./analyze.sh`)
doesn't know what the output of command 1 is because it isn't specified.
The split command generates output based on the input filenames it is given.

Since we wrote the `./do_count` script, we know that it generates files with a
`.counts` extension. But since we don't explicitly specify the files, in
this case Basespaceapp cannot assume the file names generated by step 1 and this
config file is invalid.

We can tell basespaceapp what the output should look like by using an output pattern.

```
[COMMANDS]
./do_counts {1||2} {o:*.counts}
./analyze.sh {*.counts}

[FILES]
1. foo.txt
2. bar.txt
```

The above example tells basespaceapp that the output of command 1, which is
hardcoded in the script will have an output that ends in `.counts`. Now that
the output of command 1 is known, command 2 will wait until command 1 finishes.

When the output marker has the form `{o}`, then basespaceapp will insert a
pregenerated filename to the command. The output marker `{o:<pattern>}` means
that the output of the script is *not* determined by the input of the script,
but it *will* match given pattern. This means that later commands will be able
to reference the files by name.


### Multiple Inputs and Outputs

Often times a given shell command will either take multiple dynamic files as input, or generate multiple files as output. In either case, basespaceapp provides a way to manage and track these files.

For multiple inputs, basespaceapp expects the number of inputs per command to be the same, and will iterate over them in order.

**Example:**

```bash
# Given the following:
[COMMANDS]
bash somescript {1||2||3} --conf {4||5||6}  > {o}

[FILES]
1. somefile.1
2. somefile.2
3. somefile.3

# Basespaceapp will return this:
bash somescript somefile.1 --conf somefile.4  > basespaceapp.1.1.output
bash somescript somefile.2 --conf somefile.5  > basespaceapp.1.2.output
bash somescript somefile.3 --conf somefile.6  > basespaceapp.1.3.output
```

Basespaceapp will name the multiple output files as follows (in order from left to right):

`basespaceapp.{command_number}.{sub_command_number}-{output_number}`

**Example:**

```bash
# Given an input like the one below:
[COMMANDS]
bash somescript {1||2||3} --log {o} -r {o}

[FILES]
1. somefile.1
2. somefile.2
3. somefile.3

# basespaceapp will generate the following:
bash somescript somefile.1 --log basespaceapp.1.1-1.output -r basespaceapp.1.1-2.output
bash somescript somefile.2 --log basespaceapp.1.2-1.output -r basespaceapp.1.2-2.output
bash somescript somefile.3 --log basespaceapp.1.3-1.output -r basespaceapp.1.3-2.output
```



## Sample config.mp file

```bash
[COMMANDS]
# Trim and cut your sample fastq files.
# Basespaceapp will handle naming the output files for you!
# Basespaceapp will trim all of the files at once! (see parallel)
trimmomatic -o {o} {*.fastq.gz||}

# Basespaceapp will manage your dependencies for you!
# Take all the outputs of step 1 and feed them to cutadapt.
cutadapt -o {o} {basespaceapp.1.*.output||}

# Next you need to align them.
htseq <alignment options> -o {o} {basespaceapp.2.*.output||}

# Of course, now you'll have some custom code to put all the data together. 
# That's fine too!

# Oh no! You hardcode the output name? No problem! Just tell basespaceapp 
# what the filename is.
python my_custom_code.py {basespaceapp.3.*.output,} #{o:hardcoded_output.csv}

# Now you want to compare your results to some controls? Ok!
# Basespaceapp wil compare your hardcoded_output to all 3 controls at the same time!
python my_compare_script.py --compare-to {1||2||3} {hardcoded_output.csv} 

# Finally, you want to make some pretty graphs? No problem!
# But wait! You want R 2.0 for this code? Just create an alias for R!
Rscript my_cool_graphing_code.r {basespaceapp.5.*.output} > {o}

[FILES]
1. controls.1.csv
2. controls.2.csv
3. controls.3.csv

[PATHS]
Rscript ~/path/to/my/custom/R/version
```
